# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-CNN
Breast Cancer is a dangerous disease that has affected the life of many people all over the world. Scientists and researchers are still finding a
way to permanently cure this life-threatening illness. In this new age technology where Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are used
everywhere to solve complex problems this project also focuses on effective breast cancer classification with the help of machine learning
particularly deep learning.We have used convolution neural networks to classify non cancerous and cancerous images.At the end we get a test
accuracy as 86.98 for our CNN model.
